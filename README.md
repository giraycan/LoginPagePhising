# LoginPagePhising
I have created a phishing method using the academic system login page of Firat University, which is intended to be used exclusively within Firat University and has not been used for malicious purposes under any circumstances.
The information entered on the Firat University login page is being retrieved to your Discord channel using Discord servers.
